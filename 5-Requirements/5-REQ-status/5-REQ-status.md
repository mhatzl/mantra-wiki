# status: Show wiki status

**References:**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/tree/main): 15 (4 direct)

As product owner or developer, I want to see an overview of the requirements in the wiki,
because it helps with prioritizing future work.
e.g. by showing what requirements are not yet *active*.

Created in response to [issue #17](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/17).

# Sub-requirements

- [req:status.branch](5-REQ-status.branch)
- [req:status.cmp](5-REQ-status.cmp)
