# wiki.ref_list.branch_link: Link to branches

**References:**

- in branch main: 1

As described in [DR-20230823](6-DR-20230823) the *references* list contains an entry per branch that mantra is run against,
because each branch may have different reference counts.

In addition, a link to the branch should be set in the *references* list if a URL is provided,
to easily navigate to a branch.

**Note:** Purely convenience feature.

Created in response to [issue #1](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/1).
