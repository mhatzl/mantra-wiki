# wiki.link: Manage links to requirements

The reference syntax `[req:req_id]` is very similar to a Markdown hyperlink.
This allows to automatically add links to the requirement entry in the wiki, making references more like *wiki-links*.

*mantra* must be able to handle these links automatically, because links might change, and manual *bookkeeping* is too tedious.

## Sub-requirements

- [req:wiki.link.check]
- [req:wiki.link.update]
