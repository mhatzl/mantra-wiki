# wiki: Documentation for requirements

**References:**

- in branch main: 25 (8 direct)

Requirements must be documented at a more permanent location than in issues,
because with issues it is nearly impossible to keep track of currently *active* requirements.

Since most project management tools offer a wiki, it was decided to use it to document requirements.
The [requirements](5-Requirements) section describes when and how requirements should be documented in the wiki.

Created in response to [issue #1](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/1).
