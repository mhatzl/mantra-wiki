# qa: Quality Assurance

**References:**

- in branch main: 9 (0 direct)

*QA* requirements help to ensure a high quality for [mantra](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra).

**Note:** General *QA* requirements affect the overall architecture and implementation of [mantra](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra), because they are not specific to a feature/functionality.
Therefore, these requirements must be considered for every existing or new feature/functionality, as long as these *QA* requirements are *active*.

**Note:** Only general *QA* requirements should be part of this requirement group. *QA* requirements that are specific to a requirement group should be added to a *qa* requirement subgroup for this feature.
