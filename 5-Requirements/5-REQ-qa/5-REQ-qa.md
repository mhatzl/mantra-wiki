*QA* requirements help to ensure a high quality for [mantra](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra).

**Note:** General *QA* requirements affect the overall architecture and implementation of [mantra](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra), because they are not specific to a feature/functionality.
Therefore, these requirements must be considered for every existing or new feature/functionality, as long as these *QA* requirements are *active*.

**Note:** Only general *QA* requirements should be part of this requirement group. *QA* requirements that are specific to a requirement group should be added to a *qa* requirement subgroup for this feature.

## Sub-requirements

- [req:qa.DoD](5-REQ-qa.DoD)
- [req:qa.pipeline](5-REQ-qa.pipeline)
- [req:qa.sustain](5-REQ-qa.sustain)
- [req:qa.tracing](5-REQ-qa.tracing)
- [req:qa.ux](5-REQ-qa.ux)
