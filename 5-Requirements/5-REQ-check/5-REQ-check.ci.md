# check.ci: Add check overview as PR comment

**References:**

- in branch [main](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/tree/main): 1

As reviewer, I want to get an overview of the reference changes this PR would introduce,
because it helps to decide how to handle the PR before looking at code changes.

To easily see the overview, it must be added as comment to the PR.

Created in response to [issue #15](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/15)
