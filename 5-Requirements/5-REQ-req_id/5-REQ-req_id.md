# req_id: Requirement ID

**References:**

- in branch main: 15 (10 direct)

Every requirement must have a unique ID assigned to it in the wiki,
because some way of identification is needed to reference requirements in implementation and tests.

Created in response to [issue #1](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/1).

**Note:** The ID should already tell developers what the requirement is roughly about to help identify the correct requirement to trace.
