# sync.ci.code: CI support for *mantra sync* in the project repository

**References:**

- in branch main: 1

As a developer, I want that references are synchronized automatically with the wiki
after I merged a PR to implement a feature, because I do not want to worry about keeping the wiki up-to-date.

Created in response to [issue #1](https://github.com/mhatzl/mantra/issues/1).
