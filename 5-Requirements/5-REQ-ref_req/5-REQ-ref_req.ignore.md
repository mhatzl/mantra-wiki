# ref_req.ignore: Ignore requirement references

It must be possible to somehow notify *mantra* to ignore references,
because the reference syntax may be used as an example somewhere.

To ignore a reference, set `[mantra:ignore_next]` before the reference that should be ignored.

**Note:** This only ignores the next found reference.
