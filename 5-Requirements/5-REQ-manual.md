# `manual`: Mark requirements to require manual verification

It must be able to flag requirements to require manual verification,
because automated testing might not be enough or not possible.

## `manual.versioned`: Mark requirements as *manual* per project version

Setting a *manual* flag for requirements must be possible per project version,
because some versions may require a verification, but others might not.
