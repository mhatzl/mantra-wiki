## Test-run metadata

Test-run metadata will be stored as JSON, because it is project specific.
To still be able to render the metadata in reports, a template may be given for the metadata.

See [req(coverage.test_run)].

## Requirement snapshot for reports

A *tag* and *tag-link* may be set when creating a report to identify
the requirement *snapshot*. These arguments are optional.

See [req(report.req_snapshot)]
