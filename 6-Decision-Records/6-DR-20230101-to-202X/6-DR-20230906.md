**keywords:** wiki-link

# Remove `link` command

The `link` command was removed, because first tests and feedback showed,
that links directly in code are too distracting.
Many URLs are very long, which *hides* the relevant requirement ID, making it harder to read.

It would be better to offer an IDE plugin that can link to wiki sections when hovering over a reference.

# Alternative

Using some web-service to shorten the URL.
Something like `mantra.org/<some random id>`, where the random ID redirects to the wiki section.
This solution would require a web-service, and automatic synchronization between these random IDs and wiki sections.

In comparison, the IDE plugin seems more practical
