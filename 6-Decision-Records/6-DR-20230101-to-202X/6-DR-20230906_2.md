# Branch links are not updated automatically

It is possible to set links to branches, and the first time an entry is created, this link is set for the branch name.
However, entries not having links to branches are not updated automatically afterwards.
This behavior was chosen, because synchronization should be done per CI, and it is unlikely that a link set in the CI will change anytime soon.
If the link changes, it is still fairly easy to change it manually using *find and replace*.

Not having to check for changed branch links speeds up performance, because less string comparisons are needed.
