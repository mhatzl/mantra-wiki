# Synchronization and PR report
## Synchronization flow

1. Go through wiki
   1. Create map of existing requirement IDs
   1. Add existing counts to requirement IDs per branch

   Both tasks should be done in parallel, to only go through the wiki once in this step. 

1. Go through code and update counts for specific branch, and validate wiki-links 
1. Go through wiki and update *references* list

An alternative flow would have been to first go through code, and then update the *references* list
in the wiki, but due to possible *manual* requirement flags in sub-requirements, the wiki must be parsed at least once before updating the list.

## PR report flow

1. Go through wiki
   1. Create map of existing requirement IDs
   1. Add existing counts to requirement IDs per branch

   Both tasks should be done in parallel, to only go through the wiki once in this step. 

1. Go through code and update counts for specific branch, and validate wiki-links
1. Create PR report 
1. Optional: Write report in PR chat

Because the report does not update the wiki, the second wiki-*walkthrough* can be skipped.
